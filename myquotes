For me, it's not important to tell the details of the story.  In Japan, there is
a poet expression called a haiku [where] you don't explain some things in detail
and let the receivers understand or use their imagination with what is
presented.

That lets the receivers make their own story from their imagination, and I think

future, someone may discover there's another way to do narrative and tell
stories through gaming, but at this moment I think this is a great way to tell
stories.
